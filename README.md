# Kagura-Releases
Where I will be holding my Kagura releases for the projects.

# ATTENTION!
The RTM is currently not working on the PS3 system. It is being fixed right now and an update will be released soon.

# NOTICE
The software includes an End User License Agreement (EULA) - The included "RTM" software is not open-source to ensure the security and integrity of the community. To prevent misuse of the tool, we have implemented a banning API that restricts access for users who violate the terms of use. This allows us to take appropriate action against those who engage in prohibited activities, ensuring a safer environment for all users.

# Known Issues
- The color changer may not work. If the color changer has issues, follow these steps to fix it.
1. Locate the "color_settings.cfg" file.
2. Open the "color_settings.cfg" file in an editor such as VS Code, Notepad, etc.
3. Delete everything inside the file.
4. Once everything is deleted, paste in the following code:
```cfg
GradientColorPrimary=-32576
GradientColorSecondary=-32576
```
5. Save the file and that's it, it should work now.
